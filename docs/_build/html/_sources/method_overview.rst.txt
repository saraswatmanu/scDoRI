   :alt: scDoRI Architecture and Training Overview

**scDoRI** (single-cell Deep Multi-Omic Regulatory Inference) is a computational framework that jointly models paired single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq profiles to infer **enhancer-mediated gene regulatory networks (eGRNs)**. Unlike existing pipelines that treat dimensionality reduction and regulatory inference as distinct modules, scDoRI unifies them in a single encoder--decoder architecture grounded in biological priors.

At its core, the model learns **topics** -- regulatory modules that link co-accessible chromatin regions, their cis-mediated target genes, and upstream activator and repressor transcription factors (TFs). Each cell is represented as a **probabilistic mixture over topics**, allowing for a continuous and interpretable view of transcriptional regulation.

Architectural Components
-------------------------

scDoRI consists of two primary components:

**Encoder**
^^^^^^^^^^

- Projects high-dimensional RNA and ATAC profiles into a shared latent topic space.
- Comprised of parallel neural networks (one each for RNA and ATAC), with outputs concatenated and mapped into topic logits.
- Final output is a topic mixture vector for each cell, constrained via a softmax activation (topics sum up to 1 per cell).

**Decoder**
^^^^^^^^^^

The decoder reconstructs observed data modalities from the shared latent topic space, enforcing biologically constrained logic through four modules:

**Module 1: ATAC Reconstruction**

- Reconstructs peak accessibility using a topic--peak weight matrix.
- Includes batch-specific offsets to account for experimental variability.
- Applies L1 regularization on topic--peak weights to encourage sparsity for interpretability.

**Module 2: RNA-from-ATAC Prediction**

- Reconstructs gene expression based on predicted chromatin accessibility from Module 1.
- Employs a learnable gene--peak linkage matrix, constrained by genomic proximity (e.g., peaks within 150kb of the gene).

**Module 3: TF Expression Reconstruction**

- Learns topic-to-TF expression mappings, allowing the latent space to capture transcription factor expression programs.

**Module 4: Signed TF--Gene Network Inference**

- Computes signed topic-specific TF--gene links by integrating:
  
  - Precomputed TF--peak motif scores (activators and repressors)
  - Topic-wise chromatin accessibility
  - Gene--peak associations
  - Topic-level TF expression

- Refines scores using a learnable 3D TF--gene--topic matrix.
- Produces a final **signed GRN**, used to reconstruct gene expression from TF expression per topic (Module 3).

Training Phases
---------------

**Phase 1: Topic Construction**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The encoder and Modules 1--3 are trained jointly using multimodal reconstruction losses.
- Peak accessibility, gene expression, and TF expression are reconstructed from latent topics.
- Objective functions include Poisson likelihood loss (ATAC) and Negative Binomial likelihood loss (RNA), with regularization to promote sparsity and interpretability.

**Phase 2: GRN Refinement**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Module 4 is introduced to learn topic-specific GRNs from chromatin context, peak - gene links and TF- peak links (from insilico-ChIP-seq, introduced in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.15.496239v1).
- Adds trainable activator/repressor TF--gene link matrices per topic.
- Predicts RNA from TF expression using inferred GRNs.
- Earlier modules can optionally be frozen to preserve previously learned topic representations.

Schematic Overview
------------------

The figure above provides a schematic overview of the scDoRI model. Modules are color-coded by training phase, and matrix roles are explicitly annotated. Phase 1 involves joint training of the encoder and Modules 1--3. Phase 2 fine-tunes Module 4 to enable topic-specific GRN inference.
